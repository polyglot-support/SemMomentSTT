# SemMomentSTT: Semantic Momentum Speech-to-Text

A novel approach to continuous speech recognition using semantic momentum for improved accuracy and context understanding.

## Overview

SemMomentSTT models speech recognition as a continuous flow through semantic space, where multiple interpretations maintain momentum and compete based on both acoustic and semantic evidence. This approach enables:

- Better handling of ambiguous speech segments
- Improved context integration
- More natural handling of continuous speech
- Real-time processing capabilities

## Features

- ðŸŽ¤ Real-time speech recognition
- ðŸ”„ Continuous context integration
- ðŸ§  Semantic momentum-based disambiguation
- ðŸ“Š Multiple trajectory tracking
- âš¡ Efficient pruning and merging strategies

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SemMomentSTT.git
cd SemMomentSTT
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.main import SemMomentSTT

# Initialize the system
stt = SemMomentSTT()

# Transcribe an audio file
text = stt.transcribe_file("path/to/audio.wav")
print(text)

# Real-time transcription from microphone
for text_segment in stt.transcribe_microphone():
    print(text_segment, end="", flush=True)
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
stt = SemMomentSTT(
    model_name="wav2vec2-large-960h",  # Larger, more accurate model
    semantic_dim=1024,                  # Larger semantic space
    device="cuda"                       # GPU acceleration
)
```
