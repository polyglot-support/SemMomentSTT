# Semantic Momentum in Speech Recognition: A Novel Approach to Continuous Speech Understanding

## Abstract
This document outlines the design for a research project investigating the application of semantic momentum to speech recognition systems. The proposed approach models speech recognition as a continuous flow through semantic space, where multiple interpretations maintain momentum and compete based on both acoustic and semantic evidence.

- Momentum vector computation
- Semantic force field modeling
- Confidence scoring mechanism

#### 1.3 Integration Layer
- Acoustic-semantic mapping
- Context integration
- Trajectory pruning and merging

### 2. Key Innovations

#### 2.1 Momentum-Based Disambiguation
